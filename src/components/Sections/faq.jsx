        <Text>What is Prime Pass? Prime Pass is a NFT Project with the best utility and very good art!</Text>

        <Text>When is the mint date and what is the price? The mint date is April 23rd at 6am PST and the price is 0.08 ETH.</Text>

        <Text>What do I need to have to mint a NFT? Just make sure you have a crypto wallet like MetaMask with ETH in it. You can buy ETH on many exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Crypto.com.</Text>

        <Text>Why are you building on Ethereum? Won&apos;t gas fees be high? Ethereum is the main blockchain for nfts, we will do our best and make sure gas fees are as low as we can make them.</Text>

        <Text>Is there rarity? Why should I buy more than 1? No, each nft will have the same privileges, but if you own more than 1 nft you will get another vote in what we do next. There will also be more benefits in the future.</Text>

        <Text>What does Prime Pass have that other Alpha groups donâ€™t? Prime Pass is not just your regular Alpha group because of the big amount of utility, it is in roadmap. Check it out!</Text>

        <Text>Will there be a reveal and how long? No, the nft will go straight to your wallet with the art!</Text>

        <Text>Will there be a Public mint? Yes, there will be a WL and Public mint, the time between them is TBA as of now.</Text>
